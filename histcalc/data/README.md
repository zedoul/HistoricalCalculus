Dataset
========
I stored historical fiscal data usually based on UK source. Unfortunately, I am not able to get all the source from greater powers. So I use exchange currency rate in other nation stead if I am not able to get them. Subsequently, I mainly concentrate to a certain, well discussed era such as Napoleonic war period or 1st World War.
